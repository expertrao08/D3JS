					<div class="iframe_descr">
						<p> 
							&emsp; &emsp; Divorce rates and depression rates are correlated with a correlation coefficient of around 0.535. 
							This does not seem to surprising, as people often divorce if they are unhappy and may remain unhappy over 
							a failed marriage. However, it could also be the case that people become unhappy after being divorced. 
						</p>
						<p> 
							&emsp; &emsp; There is also a weaker correlation between being in poverty and having had a heart attack 
							(correlation coefficient = 0.397). This could be due the stress caused by poverty or that those in poverty 
							have poorer diets. 
						</p>
						<p> 
							&emsp; &emsp; A final correlation of note is the relationship between being unemployed and having gone to
							the doctors within the previous year at the time of sampling (coefficient = 0.365). This means that being unemployed
							was associated with more frequent doctor visits, as the other response categories were within the past 2 years, within
							the past 5 years, over 5 years, and never. There thus seems to be a silver lining to unemployment.  
						</p> 
						<p> 
							&emsp; &emsp; Final notes: for poverty rates and unemployment rates, Puerto Rico seems to be a big outlier, which
								I decided to leave in. Also, these are simple comparisons between US states which make no attempt at controlling
								for confounding variables. These correlations do give us an idea of where to start should we decide to further explore
								these plotted relationships.
